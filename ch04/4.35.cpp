char cval; int ival; unsigned int ui;

identify the implicit type conversions, if any, taking place:
(a) cval = 'a' + 3;  a gets converted to int then the sum gets converted to char
(b) fval = ui - ival * 1.0; ival gets converted to double then
multiplyed by 1.0 then ui getsconverted double after that the difference is converted to float
(c) dval = ui * fval;  ui gets converted to float then the product is converted to double
(d) cval = ival + fval + dval; ival is converted to float then the prosum of ival and fval is 
converted to double then the sum is coverted to char
