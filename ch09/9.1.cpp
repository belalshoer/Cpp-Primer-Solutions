unlike vectors which have fast insertion only at the end of them

(b) Read an unknown number of words. Always insert new words at the
back. Remove the next value from the front.-> a deque would be suitable because it allows fast insertion
and deletion from the front an back.

(c) Read an unknown number of integers from a file. Sort the numbers and
then print them to standard output.-> a vector would be appropriate because the elements
will be insterted at the back*/
