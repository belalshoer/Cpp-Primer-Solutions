the constructor that takes a container to copy copies the whole container and checks for the types

the constructors that takes two iterrators uses them to denote a range and we can copy a subsequence 
with its aid but it doesn't impose restrictions on their types if the type of the container that is being copied
can be converted to the other container's type, the operation will succeed
